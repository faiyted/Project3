## Summary Notes:
### Satisfaction with Remote Work by Work Location
Satisfaction is slightly higher for onsite workers compared to hybrid and remote. <br>
Remote work has a lower satisfaction rate, with higher percentages in the Neutral and Unsatisfied categories.<br>
Hybrid work shows a fairly even distribution, with no dominant satisfaction level, which might suggest that hybrid work arrangements cater to a wide range of experiences.
### Average Hours WOrked by Mental Health Condition
Overall, while all groups are close to a standard 40-hour workweek, there is a slight trend where increasing hours align with mental health challenges, with burnout showing the highest hours worked. <br>This points to the importance of monitoring workloads and ensuring resources are available to help manage mental health, especially as hours begin to exceed the standard 40-hour mark.
### High Stress Level by Age Range
The analysis reveals that stress is particularly high among individuals aged 26-45, highlighting a critical period in life where work, family, and personal development intersect. <br>
Understanding these trends allows organizations and individuals to take targeted action to mitigate stress, especially for those in the peak of their careers, while recognizing that stress often decreases with age or retirement.
### Access to mental health resources, company support, and physical activity compared to mental health condition
This grouped bar chart shows the relationship between access to mental health resources, physical activity, and mental health conditions like Depression, Anxiety, None, and Burnout. The chart reveals that:
Those with anxiety and depression tend to engage more in daily activities when access to resources is available.
Burnout cases have a more evenly distributed engagement across different physical activity levels, regardless of access to mental health resources.
### Stress level associated with hours work and virtual meetings
This chart visualizes the relationship between hours worked per week and the number of virtual meetings, with bubble sizes and colors indicating stress levels. Larger, darker bubbles represent higher stress levels. The distribution shows that employees with high hours worked and frequent virtual meetings are more likely to report higher stress, indicated by the darker colors and larger bubbles.
## Stress level associated with hours work and virtual meetings
This bubble chart shows the relationship between hours worked per week and virtual meetings, with stress levels represented by bubble size and color. Larger, darker bubbles indicate higher stress, while smaller, lighter bubbles show lower stress. Employees with longer hours and more meetings tend to experience higher stress, while lower stress is more spread among those with fewer work hours or meetings. The chart highlights how a heavier workload and frequent meetings are linked to increased stress.
